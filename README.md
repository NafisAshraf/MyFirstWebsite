# MyFirstWebsite

A simple website that built using html, css for frontend and flask, mysql for backend.

This is a student management system that I created as a project for a database course that I took this semester.

I created a database using XAMPP and MySQL. Then I added the functionality to view, update, delete or add student info through the website. I used flask for backend and bootstrap, html and css for frontend.
